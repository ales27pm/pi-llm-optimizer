# Project Roadmap

The roadmap captures the team priorities for Pi‑LLM Optimizer as we
iterate on the end‑to‑end distillation, quantization and deployment
experience. Items are grouped by timeframe and focus on work that
extends the capabilities already documented in `README.md` and
`AGENTS.md`.

## ✅ Recently Landed

- **Expanded QLoRA Coverage** – Documented the validated preset matrix, hardened regression coverage and exposed operator presets inside the automation UI.
  - [x] Capture a matrix of tested quantization settings in `desktop_distill/train_student.py` docstrings and mirror it in `README.md`.
  - [x] Extend the pytest suite with fixtures that exercise QLoRA adapters end-to-end using a small synthetic dataset.
  - [x] Add preset dropdowns to `automation/ui_app.py` so operators can select proven QLoRA configurations without manual flag editing.
- **Dataset Blueprint Tooling** – Added the dataset card generator and JSONL utilities so every corpus ships with reproducible documentation.
- **Automation Command Builders** – Unified CLI assembly for labelling, training, export and benchmarking through `automation/pipeline_ops.py` and the Textual dashboard.
- **UI Parity with CLI** – Removed stale gradient-checkpoint flags and ensured the Textual panels mirror the authoritative script options.
- **Batch Labelling Improvements** – Teacher labelling now supports batched prompts, skip-existing safeguards and structured JSON instructions.
- **Dataset Blueprint CI Integration** – Automated dataset card validation in GitHub Actions now blocks regressions and publishes artifacts for downstream jobs.
- **Session Sync Orchestrator** – Added `automation/session_sync.py`, manifest v2 with reusable sources, and manifest enforcement toggles for the @codex automation that curates this repository. The `automation/update_and_cleanup.sh` wrapper keeps that internal agent in sync by regenerating guidance, running dry checks and surfacing stray protocols automatically, and must run before every @codex coding session concludes (i.e. at the end of each individual request/response cycle).

## ⏱️ Near Term (0‑2 Sprints)

- **Remote Model Export UX** – Add progress reporting and richer error diagnostics when resolving remote HuggingFace repos during GGUF export.
  - [ ] Integrate download progress callbacks into `desktop_distill/export_gguf.py` and surface them in CLI logs.
  - [ ] Implement structured exception handling that outputs actionable remediation hints when remote resolution fails.
  - [ ] Write integration tests under `tests/` that mock failed downloads and assert user-friendly messages are emitted.
- **Benchmark Dashboards** – Emit structured metrics from `rpi4/bench/pi_bench.py` and surface summaries within the Textual UI.
  - [ ] Refactor `rpi4/bench/pi_bench.py` to emit JSON summaries alongside CSV output for consumption by dashboards.
  - [ ] Update `automation/ui_app.py` to visualize recent benchmark runs in a dedicated panel with trend lines.
  - [ ] Document how to launch the dashboard mode inside `automation/ui_app.tcss`/ `README.md`, including expected data refresh cadence.

## 🔭 Mid Term (Quarter)

- **Pipeline Profiles** – Ship reusable YAML profiles that capture common end-to-end flows (e.g. TinyLlama tutoring, Qwen bilingual assistant) and hydrate the command builders automatically.
  - [ ] Define a YAML schema (with JSON Schema validation) covering teacher/student ids, dataset sources and automation presets.
  - [ ] Implement profile loading in `automation/pipeline_ops.py`, falling back to existing CLI arguments when profiles are absent.
  - [ ] Add profile selection controls to the Textual UI and document sample profiles under `automation/profiles/`.
- **Multi-Node Training Experiments** – Investigate DeepSpeed or FSDP for large teacher fine-tuning while keeping the student path lightweight.
  - [ ] Prototype a DeepSpeed configuration for the teacher model using a constrained dataset to validate scaling assumptions.
  - [ ] Benchmark FSDP against LoRA-only baselines and summarize token throughput in `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`.
  - [ ] Document hardware prerequisites and trade-offs for each strategy in `README.md`'s advanced training section.
- **Enhanced Dataset Tooling** – Add schema validation helpers for tool-augmented conversations and surface dialect coverage warnings in the Textual UI.
  - [ ] Extend `dataset/qf_corpus_blueprint/scripts/jsonl_utils.py` with schema validation hooks that can be shared by CLI and tests.
  - [ ] Render dialect coverage summaries in the Textual UI with warning banners when corpora fall below thresholds.
  - [ ] Author documentation for new validation rules, including remediation suggestions, in the dataset blueprint README.
- **Pi Runtime Packaging** – Produce a Debian package that installs the llama.cpp runtime, helper scripts and systemd units for background decoding services.
  - [ ] Create `rpi4/package/` with Debian packaging metadata and reproducible build scripts.
  - [ ] Automate package builds via GitHub Actions, attaching `.deb` artifacts to releases.
  - [ ] Provide installation and service management instructions in the Raspberry Pi setup guide.

## 🧭 Long Term (6+ Months)

- **Model Zoo Publishing** – Host a curated catalog of distilled models with reproducible dataset cards, training configs and GGUF exports.
  - [ ] Stand up a static site (e.g. GitHub Pages) fed from a structured `model_catalog.json` maintained in-repo.
  - [ ] Automate GGUF upload and metadata publishing as part of release workflows.
  - [ ] Provide dataset card templates and release checklists for new models within the documentation site.
- **Edge Accelerator Support** – Prototype Metal / CoreML export paths for Apple Silicon along with Vulkan backends for other ARM devices.
  - [ ] Evaluate llama.cpp Metal builds and document required flags for macOS/iOS targets.
  - [ ] Investigate Vulkan compute support on Raspberry Pi-class devices and capture findings in `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`.
  - [ ] Add abstraction layers in the runtime scripts so accelerator selection is configurable per device profile.
- **Data Privacy Tooling** – Integrate automated redaction checks and audit logging for sensitive training data.
  - [ ] Incorporate PII redaction passes into the dataset labelling pipeline with opt-in CLI flags.
  - [ ] Store redaction reports alongside dataset cards for auditing.
  - [ ] Establish governance documentation describing privacy review expectations for contributors.
- **Community Contribution Path** – Document contribution templates and governance for external dataset and model submissions.
  - [ ] Draft contribution templates for datasets, training recipes and runtime scripts under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
  - [ ] Define review checklists and escalation paths in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
  - [ ] Host quarterly community sync notes summarizing roadmap changes and published contributions.

## 📌 How to Contribute

- Track roadmap issues under the `#roadmap` GitHub label.
- Propose changes via pull requests that link to the relevant roadmap item.
- Keep documentation (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, dataset cards) updated as features land so the roadmap stays an accurate forward-looking plan.
