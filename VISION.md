# Vision

This project aims to deliver a **production-grade** system with on-device autonomy, zero drift, and high observability. We prioritise:
- Full implementations over speed.
- Deterministic behaviour and reproducibility.
- Clear interfaces, strong typing, and explicit invariants.
- Security, privacy, and least-privilege by default.

**Anti-drift:** All decisions must trace back to this file or to an approved design note linked from `OVERVIEW.md`. If a change diverges from the vision, create/append a design note and link it here before proceeding.
