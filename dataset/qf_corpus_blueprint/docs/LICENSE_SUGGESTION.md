# Licensing Guidance

To ensure transparent reuse of the Québec French corpus, consider the
following licensing strategy:

1. **Primary corpus (text + annotations)** – Use a Creative Commons
   Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA 4.0) license when source material
   permits. This maintains openness while ensuring derivatives remain
   open.
2. **Metadata & schema** – Release under CC0 1.0 to maximise
   interoperability with downstream projects.
3. **Scripts & utilities** – Adopt the Apache 2.0 license to align with
   the broader `pi-llm-optimizer` tooling and offer patent protection.

If your source material carries incompatible licensing (e.g., broadcast
archives), create access tiers:

- A **public metadata-only** release that exposes provenance and
  sociolinguistic descriptors.
- A **restricted textual layer** accessible to approved researchers
  through data use agreements.

When in doubt, consult your institution’s legal counsel and document the
chosen license in the dataset README and project site. Always attribute
original content creators and respect indigenous or community ownership
statements when applicable.
