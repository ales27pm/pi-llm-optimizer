# Privacy Impact Assessment Checklist (Starter)

Use this checklist as a baseline when preparing a Privacy Impact
Assessment (PIA) for Québec French corpus work. Adapt and expand it to
match your organisational policies and the jurisdictions that govern
your research.

## 1. Governance

- [ ] Identify the data controller and processor roles within the
      project.
- [ ] Document the research purpose, retention limits, and point of
      contact for privacy inquiries.
- [ ] Confirm compliance with provincial and federal privacy
      legislation (e.g., Quebec Law 25, PIPEDA).

## 2. Data Inventory

- [ ] Catalogue all personal data fields (including latent identifiers
      like rare dialect markers).
- [ ] Map data sources, ingestion methods, storage locations, and access
      controls.
- [ ] Record lawful bases for processing and consent artefacts when
      applicable.

## 3. Risk Assessment

- [ ] Evaluate re-identification risk across sociolinguistic
      combinations (region, age, education, gender).
- [ ] Assess potential harms from dialect-sensitive content (e.g., slurs,
      sacres).
- [ ] Determine k-anonymity or l-diversity thresholds for publication.

## 4. Mitigation Measures

- [ ] Apply minimisation: drop attributes not required for training or
      evaluation.
- [ ] Implement access controls (role-based permissions, audit trails).
- [ ] Define retention and deletion workflows for raw vs. enriched
      datasets.
- [ ] Provide redaction or pseudonymisation procedures for sensitive
      passages.

## 5. Transparency & Accountability

- [ ] Draft participant and partner disclosures explaining corpus use.
- [ ] Publish data documentation (e.g., dataset cards, README) outlining
      provenance and licensing.
- [ ] Establish incident response steps for privacy breaches.

## 6. Review & Approval

- [ ] Schedule regular PIA reviews as the corpus evolves.
- [ ] Capture approvals from ethics boards or internal governance
      councils.

**Reminder:** The checklist is a starting point—augment it with legal
counsel review and community feedback before releasing corpus artefacts.
